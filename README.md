# advent-of-code

A collection of "dog ugly" javascript solutions to Advent of Code problems. I use "dog-ugly" in the sense of the classic Sandlot quote "If my dog were as ugly as you, I'd shave his butt and tell him to walk backwards.". Designed to be run in the browser dev console on the problem input tab, no guarantees of readability or optimization.
